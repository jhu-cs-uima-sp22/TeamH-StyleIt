# TeamH-StyleIt
Team H's repo for the app Style It

During our first sprint we set up the backbone and framework for the android application. The first step was to create the different activities and fragments so that all the pages we would need later are properly created. Additionally, we set up our bottom navigation bar so that we could properly route to our different app pages. 

A log-in/register page was set up and used in conjunction with Forebase to provide user authentication and accounts for eht eapp. Additionally, on the post displayal through the home page, we incorporated an on-click feature for bringing up a details page or the post. On this page users can view more information about the post, including likes and dislikes where they can upvote or downvote the post. 

We also decided to implement the main functionality for the Profile and Home pages of our app. In a technical sense, this included:
* Creating a Post class that holds the information regarding all posts
* User class for login/creating posts
* Firebase integration for Authentication and Real-Time Database functionality.
* RecyclerView with Adapter methods to display the Posts.

A post creation page was implemented so that users are able to contribute to the community(Home) feed. In this activity users must specify the necessary componenets of a post and publish their thoughts. The logged in users is tied to the post and their name will be properly displayed.

A user profile page displays the logged in user's personal information including their name and email. THere they can also upload a profile picture and add a short description of who they are. 

All the relevant pages were styled following our initial design document, utilizing the purple color scheme.
