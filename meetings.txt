Meeting Minutes:

4/24/22:
Today we had a brief meeting to discuss what has to be done in Sprint 2. We discussed some of the issues we experienced in the first
sprint and how we were going to split up the workload to complete it. Furthermore, we talked about specific things we have to implement
in this next sprint, including layouts for the item details/item creation page, allowing users to delete their posts, and adding a
search bar so that users could search through listings according to item name or seller name.

5/1/22:
Today we went over what is left to complete sprint 2. We have finished the basic layout for the item details page, allowed users to
delete posts, updated the search feature, and more. We went over next week's goals which included fixing the bugs with the comments
page and likes, which we believe we can resolve after getting a access to the specific post id's from the database. Additionally,
we want to implement the functionality to email a seller when a user clicks the buy button.

5/7/22:
Today, we met in order to discuss what needed to be done to reach the finale of our project. The comment section and likes were deemed
to be the main task for the day, with additional tasks including styling issues, deletion of posts, and image use. We set a deadline
of tonight for these action items and worked diligently as a group in order to complete all the tasks. We discussed last weeks goal
of finishing the comments page and the buy button implementations. The buy button was fully functional but there a was a slight bug
in the comment section.
